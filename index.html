<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
<p>I am a college junior, majoring in Biology and minoring in Professional and Technical Writing. I keep myself busy, working at Chick-fil-A and the Institute of Biohealth Innovation, as well as dogsitting and babysitting. In my free time, I like to read and play video games.</p>
